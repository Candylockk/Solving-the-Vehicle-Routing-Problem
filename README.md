# Solving-the-Vehicle-Routing-Problem
My implementation of the Vehicle Routing Problem, given multiple vehicles delivering multiple orders. 

The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?". It generalises the well-known travelling salesman problem (TSP). It first appeared in a paper by George Dantzig and John Ramser in 1959, in which first algorithmic approach was written and was applied to petrol deliveries.
